### Phase 1: Setup, Downl
- [X] Set up repository directory structure
    - [X] Set up environment
    - [X] Set up sub folder for code
- [ ] Let's write a script to download one file from PACE-OCI
    - https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/missions/pace-oci/
    - Find out what API we can query for information about the available data
    - Filter what we download based on our requirements 
    - Look at the file format (images). 
    - Look at raw data + see how to parse it.
- [ ] Write script to figure out the shape.
    - Find a tool to open our images.
    - Look at what bands are available in the imagery
    - Select which processing level to use
    - Define the parameters that our function will need
        - Start date, end date,
        - Data validity/filter settings
        - Area of interest
        - Further parameters to be added
- [ ] Preprocess data / Validation (TBD on location / wish issues)
    - Deal with invalidated data
    - Data normalization scale
- [ ] Write a function to divide large image into smaller chunks
- [ ] Plot the sample chunks that were divided
- [ ] Packager Code 
    - Package into a nice function
    - Selecting an output format for our final data set 
- [ ] Visualization Code 
    - Decide on the specific graphs 
- [ ] Validation using EDA
    - Dimensionality Reduction and visualization of chunks / anomalies in chunks
